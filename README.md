WinlatorXR is a port of Winlator for Meta Quest and Pico headsets. It uses https://github.com/amwatson/2DVrHybrid to combine 2D Android UI APIs with XR integration.

* Winlator is originally developed by brunodev85 but as he does not opensource the latest versions then I am forced to use an own fork for this project.
* In 2024 WinlatorXR was based on GLIBC fork by longjunyu2 but as he stopped communicating, the project was inactive for a long time and later it stopped working.
* In 2025 Pipetto-crypto ported Winlator to Bionic/Proton which is a massive boost for Meta Quest integration.
* His integration was enhanced by coffincolors in Winlator CMOD fork which is now base for WinlatorXR.
* Pico support and XR enhancement were brought by Tobbe85.

# Useful Tips

- If you are experiencing performance issues, try changing the Box86/Box64 preset in Container Settings -> Advanced Tab.
- For applications that use .NET Framework, try installing Wine Mono found in Start Menu -> System Tools.
- If some older games don't open, try adding the environment variable MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR=2003 in Container Settings -> Environment Variables.
- Try running the games using the shortcut on the Winlator home screen, there you can define individual settings for each game.
- To speed up the installers, try changing the Box86/Box64 preset to Intermediate in Container Settings -> Advanced Tab.
